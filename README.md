# Next.js: Handling Unexpected Null Data in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky issue in Next.js applications:  Unexpected null or undefined data returned from `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` leading to component crashes.  The problem arises when asynchronous data fetching operations don't resolve properly before the component attempts to access the data.

## The Problem
The provided `bug.js` file shows a scenario where a fetch request to an API might fail, returning null.  If the component tries to access a property of this null object (e.g., `data.title`), a runtime error will occur.

## The Solution
The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`, involves robust error handling.  We check for null or undefined data before rendering the component, preventing the crash.  Optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators help handle this gracefully.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error (in `bug.js`) or the successful rendering (in `bugSolution.js`).

## Lessons Learned
Always anticipate potential failures in your data fetching mechanisms. Implement comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage unexpected null or undefined data, using techniques like optional chaining and nullish coalescing to prevent runtime crashes.
